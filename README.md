# QCGAN_ECG
Quantum conditional generative adversarial network based on patch method for abnormal electrocardiogram generation

## Dataset
The original heartbeat data is from https://physionet.org/about/database/ <br>
ECGDataPropcess.py is used for heartbeat preprocessing: Denoising and Fragment.

## Deep CNN
A deep convolutional neural network used to detect the generated ECG signals.

## GAN_ecg
The generation model, to be continued.
